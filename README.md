# Pig Latin Translator
Translator is programmed by usual (but not the only) pig latin rules. 

Important notes concerning translator:
-	Translator preserves all characters/symbols (such as „-?->!“) from the original text, so also punctuation won’t be deleted.
-	As there are no rules about uppercase/lowercase letters, translator converts all to lowercase from practical and esthetic reasons.
-	Numbers and words starting with numbers (f.e. 1990s) are preserved, bud excluded from translation
-	As suffix for words starting with vowels and silent consonants was chosen „way“.

Translator was programmed in PHP with OOP without using any framework, as it would be uneffective for this kind of project.

Simple front-end part is created with help of bootstrap.
